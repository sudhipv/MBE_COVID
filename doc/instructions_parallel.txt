Instructions to run code in Parallel for FreeFEM++ in DRAC machines.



1. Create a Freefem init file as below

Refer documentation for more details : (https://doc.freefem.org/introduction/installation.html) under heading Environment variables and init file.

inside $(HOME)/.freefem++.pref.


    1.1 cd $(HOME)

    1.2 vi .freefem++.pref

    ############### Sample of file #################################


    verbosity = 0
    loadpath += "/home/sudhipv/software/FreeFem-sources/plugin/mpi"
    includepath += "/home/sudhipv/software/FreeFem-sources/idp"


    #################################################################


2.(If its not already loaded) load the same modules as you used for installation.

    Only for Niagara

    2.1 module load CCEnv

    2.2 module load StdEnv/2020

    Graham and Cedar by default has StdEnv/2020

    2.3 module load intelmpi

3. Clone the repository

    3.1 git clone https://sudhipv@bitbucket.org/sudhipv/mbe_covid.git


4. cd mbe_covid/ontario

Note : Output can be visualized by uncommenting the savevtk command inside the ".edp" file.
Lines 367 - 375 for initial conitions, lines 726-735 for final output.
The vtk files are only created for some particular time steps, user can change that in the above lines.
Be sure to create the output folder as "mkdir ./output" inside the same folder as the code (.edp file) resides to save these .vtk files.


Note: The batch file is just a sample and user needs to modify parameters such as account name, email, FreeFEM++ location etc. in order to run the code.
Also, note that the script file should be inside the same folder as the .edp file to succesfully run the code.

5. Submit script using batch file as given in runff_niagara.sh inside present folder.

    5.1 sbatch runff_niagara.sh




It will create files similar to ones shown below. Here the code is ran with 4 subdomains. ".pvd" file combines all the vtu files.

u_poisson_4_0000_0.vtu
u_poisson_4_0000_1.vtu
u_poisson_4_0000_2.vtu
u_poisson_4_0000_3.vtu
u_poisson_4.pvd


6. Copy all the .vtu and .pvd files to local machine for contour plots as in Fig.11 and Fig 12.

7. "compartment_scal.dat" contains the integrated value for all the five compartments for all timesteps. Copy this file to generate the time trace of infections as in : Fig.10 of article.

8. Files "iterScal.dat" and "N_scal.dat" are the Picard iteration counts for each time step and sum of all compartments at each time step. These are just for information.
